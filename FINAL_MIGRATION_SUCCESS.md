# ðŸŽ‰ VeeFore Migration - Complete Success!

## âœ… Firebase Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Firebase Admin SDK initialization was failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" and "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'cert')"

**Root Cause**: ES module import issue with Firebase Admin SDK

**Solution**: Changed import from `import * as admin from 'firebase-admin'` to `import admin from 'firebase-admin'`

**Result**: Firebase now initializes successfully with service account
